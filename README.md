# Java-CafeApp

This is my first React Native project I worked on just to experiment with and play around with React Native. During my bootcamp I didn't know what to do as a portfolio project. An instructor recommended don't put a lot of pressure on myself by trying to build the next Facebook, Instead try something smaller/simple. He recommended I pick a coffee shop in my area, see if they have an app. If they don't, build it. If they do try to replicate it, if it sucks make it better. lol. 

So that's what I did. I found a shop that doesn't have an app and created it. I used React native navigaion, Cards components, react-native-maps, imagebackgrounds, animation, and others technologies. 

Feel free to comment and give criticism. I'm always looking for ways to improve.
